## Hello human!

Congratulations on stumbling into my GitHub corner!

I'm a professional technical writer, a full-time Linux user, and an amateur photographer. I love coffee, Laugengeb√§ck, and PHP.

I'm not much of a coder, but I've cobbled together a handful of tools and scripts for my personal use. The fruits of my coding endeavors are available here.

I do have a proper website too: [T≈çky≈ç Made](https://tokyoma.de/)
